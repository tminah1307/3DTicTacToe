# 3D Tic Tac Toe
This project is a remake and update of a 5x5 Tic Tac Toe AI project originally implemented in Java. The game has been redesigned to feature a three-dimensional playing board.

## Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game enjoyed by players of all ages. In this version, the traditional 3x3 grid has been expanded into a 3D playing field, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board, aiming to form a winning pattern across rows, columns, or layers.
