# 3D Tic Tac Toe
This project presents a remake and enhancement of an AI project originally implemented in Java for 5x5 Tic Tac Toe. The scope has been expanded to encompass a three-dimensional playing board, transforming the game into a 3D version of Tic Tac Toe. The AI algorithms and strategies were adapted and optimised to reflect the increased complexity of the three-dimensional gameplay environment.

## Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game enjoyed by players of all ages. In this version, the traditional 3x3 grid has been expanded into a 3D playing field, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board, aiming to form a winning pattern across rows, columns, or layers.

This project was inspired by the research paper titled "MCTS-Minimax Hybrids" by Hendrik Baier and Mark H. M. Winands. In their paper, Baier and Winands proposed novel strategies for combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Minimax algorithms, exploring the potential synergy between these two approaches in game-playing AI.

The insights and methodologies presented in their paper significantly influenced the design and implementation of the AIPlayer class in this project. Using fixed-depth minimax searches for choosing rollout moves, as discussed in their paper, was incorporated into the AIPlayer class to enhance the quality of rollouts in the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.

Many thanks to the authors Hendrik Baier and Mark H. M. Winands for their valuable contributions to the field of artificial intelligence in game playing.
